# README

- I can add a Header component by doing: `<Route path="/" component={Header}/>`.  If it has a slash (which
every path will, it will show up).
- The Redux setup process has many steps; I need to look into it again and just memorize each step.  I need to be
able to set it up (and essentially derive it) without my notes
- Next steps are to set-up ReduxForm and be able to add new posts
- Look into NavLink and see how I could use its 'isActive' property
- This is how I can link: `<button onClick={() => this.props.history.push('/posts/new')}>New Post</button>`
